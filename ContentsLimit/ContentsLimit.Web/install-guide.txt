1. C: Spec said no validation - I used an enum to represent the category, so there is a check to ensure integrity there. Not application validation.
2. C: I used .net core 3.1.3 and SQLExpress as the datastore. 
3. C. Solution contains 4 projects, 3 for the actual app, 1 unit test project. 
4. H: For the overall total I thought it would be good to display the number of categories which make up the total.
5. H: Display a friendly message if there are no items in any category.
6: H: I use CSS nth selectors to differentiate between the different categories
7: H: Accessibility, BS4, tooltips, placeholders, etc.
